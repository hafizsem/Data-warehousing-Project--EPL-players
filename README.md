# Project Overview

## 1.0 Background and Introduction

### 1.1 Introduction
Football, or soccer, stands as the most widely embraced sport globally. With two teams of 11 players each striving to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal without using hands, football has become the world's most popular ball game. Originating in the 18th century, its widespread appeal is evident in the multitude of participants and spectators it attracts. International competitions in Europe, such as the prestigious leagues, have played a pivotal role in the sport's organization and global popularity. This case study meticulously explores the football-related datasets of the top 5 European leagues – Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga, and Ligue 1 – spanning from 2014 to 2020.

### 1.2 Problem to be Solved
Football's universal recognition has led to numerous tournaments determining the best teams globally. Events like the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Football Tournament, and European Championship witness the participation of countries striving for victory. Focusing specifically on the top 5 European leagues from 2014 to 2020, this project aims to showcase the relationships within the datasets collected from these leagues. Key objectives include:

- Build Expected Goals Models and Compare Players
- Make Comparisons Between Top 5 European Leagues
- Show Relationships from the Datasets
- Cleanup and Transform the Data
- Create an Interactive Dashboard for Football Dataset Analysis

## Visualizations Analysis

### Visualization (1): Fouls by Season Based on League
The visual analysis reveals that the highest total fouls occurred in the 2014 season, reaching 50,763, while the lowest fouls were recorded in 2019 at 43,462.

### Visualization (2): Fouls and Yellow Cards by League
The dataset points to Sassuolo having the highest fouls (3,960), while Athletic Club amassed the highest yellow cards (708). Serie A emerged with the highest fouls, whereas La Liga recorded the most yellow cards. The majority of leagues exhibited foul counts exceeding 2250 and yellow cards exceeding 345.

### Visualization (3) & (4): Yellow and Red Cards by Season
The data analysis indicates that the 2015 season witnessed the highest yellow cards, surpassing 2020 by 12.73%. Similarly, the 2015 season had the highest red cards, exceeding 2020 by 40.25%.

### Visualization (5): Top 10 Goal Scorers by Players Based on League and Season
La Liga secured the highest total goals (102), trailed by Bundesliga (96) and Serie A (53). Lionel Messi from La Liga contributed 11.93% of the total goals from 2014-2020. The 2019 season saw Bundesliga lead in average goals, followed by Serie A, La Liga, and the Premier League.

### Visualization (6): Goals vs. Expected Goals by Players Based on League and Season
The analysis shows a significant divergence between goals and expected goals, notably in Lionel Messi's case, where goals exceeded expected goals by 39. The negative correlation between goals and total expected goals suggests that players with low expected goals can still be top scorers. Edin Dzeko, for instance, had higher expected goals than actual goals but did not secure the top scorer position.

## 6.0 Conclusion

Football's immense popularity has made it a focal point of interest and analysis. This project successfully explored and visualized data from the top 5 European leagues, shedding light on fouls, cards, and goal-scoring dynamics. The establishment of a relational model, data warehouse schema, and an ETL process facilitated effective data management. Despite challenges in data import, successful solutions were implemented, and the project highlighted the importance of football data analytics in understanding the nuances of the sport.
